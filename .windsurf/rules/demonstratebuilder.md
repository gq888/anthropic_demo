Design and implement a comprehensive demonstration project based on the article titled "How we built our multi-agent research system.md" within the project. The demonstration should accurately reflect the key concepts, architecture, and functionality described in the article. 

Requirements:
1. System Architecture: Replicate the multi-agent research system architecture as detailed in the article, including agent communication flows, task distribution mechanisms, and knowledge sharing components.
2. Implementation: Develop a functional prototype that demonstrates core capabilities described in the article, including agent creation, task assignment, research process simulation, and result aggregation.
3. LLM Integration: Utilize environment variables from the .env file to configure and connect to real large language models for authentic demonstrations. Implement proper API client handling, request/response management, and error handling for LLM interactions.
4. User Interface: Create an intuitive interface to showcase the multi-agent system's operation, including visualizations of agent interactions, task progress tracking, and research outcome presentation.

Deliverables should include complete source code, configuration files, setup instructions, and a working demonstration that can be executed locally with proper .env configuration. Ensure the implementation accurately represents the article's content while maintaining code quality, modularity, and extensibility.
